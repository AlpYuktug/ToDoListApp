# ToDoListApp

What did I use to improve the app? 

When I developed ToDoListApp, I use: 

Java (Android) 

PHP (Web Service) 

MySQL (Database) 

Volley (JSON Parse) 

GitHub Libraries (App) 

How to install and run? 

The application is located on the GitHub platform. You can review source code, clone or download last apk. You can reach the project with  [this link.](https://github.com/AlpYuktug/ToDoListApp)


After installing the application on your phone, you do not need to take any action. You can register and use the application. Just check your internet connection.
